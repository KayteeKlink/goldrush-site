# Testing & Automation

### **Streamlining Processes and Enhancing Software Reliability**

---

### Project Overview:
If you didn't catch this already, I love test. There’s nothing better than automating the mundane and ensuring hardwork is in a high-quality build. I love designing test environments. I'm passionate about it because it's an area in software engineering where strategy really comes into play. It’s not just about writing tests; it’s about crafting an ecosystem of fast, reliable, and informative testing processes. I'm passionate about separating concerns—unit tests, client automation tests, backend tests—and then building backwards, creating mocking solutions so each component is tested in speedy, isolation. It’s incredibly satisfying to create pipelines that streamline the development process, reducing the need for tedious manual testing while ensuring key features always work. Damn, I love it.

### Key Contributions:

- **Comprehensive Test Planning:** Developed and managed a detailed project plan for testing initiatives in JIRA, fostering team collaboration and providing clear visibility into project progress and resource needs.
- **Test Framework Development:** Built a test automation framework from the ground up using Kotlin, Espresso, MockWebServer, GCP, and Firebase Test Lab, significantly enhancing test coverage and reliability.
- **Efficiency Improvements:** Reduced regression testing and release times from two weeks to just two hours by creating a comprehensive test environment with automated runs and Slack-integrated reporting.
- **Advocacy for Unit Testing:** Promoted best practices in unit testing by refactoring logic from views into view models, improving testability and software stability.
- **Mocking Services:** Developed mocking services for backend and security components, enabling isolated testing and more reliable results.
- **Automation for Non-Engineering Teams:** Designed and implemented an automation solution for the Sales team, developing a tool that automatically delivers ad screenshots to a Google Drive folder via a cron job.
